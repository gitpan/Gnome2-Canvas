these are brand-new, very quickly made bindings, so there are still 
some bugs.  the ones i know about are:

- canvas_demo/canvas-curve.pl bombs when you click in the canvas; 
  actually at trying to set the bpath property of the new canvas item.

- zooming the canvases by holding the arrows in the spinbuttons sometimes
  results in a segfault.  not at all sure why.

- the non-english text in canvas_demo/canvas-rich-text.pl is apparently
  very much not right.


other issues:

the documentation in README and Canvas.pm is still exactly the same text
as the Gnome2 module's files, because i borrowed them.
